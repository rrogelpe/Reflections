When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	when you want to share code with a group or are working on a group project. Git hub makes it easier for programmers
to collaborate or projects when working on a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It is just another way of staying safe in terms of avoiding commiting changes you don't really want.
